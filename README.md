# FootyFeeds
FootyFeeds is a football news aggregator that uses RSS feeds to gather all the latest Premier League and Championship football news.

FootyFeeds allows users to view news stories related to the team they support and to select which sources they want to see news from.

The backend of FootyFeeds uses Node/Express to provide the API for retrieving team/news data. RSS feeds are checked every 30 minutes for new articles which are saved in a PostgreSQL database.

AngularJS is used for the frontend.

# Social features
You can register an account with FootyFeeds and your source preferences will be saved and remembered.

In the future more social features are planned such as commenting on articles within FootyFeeds and using user activity to find the most popular/trending news stories.

# Live site
